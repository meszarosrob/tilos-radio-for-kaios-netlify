# Site for the [Tilos Radio for KaiOS](https://github.com/meszarosrob/tilos-radio-for-kaios)

## Proxy

The app uses [`tilos-radio-for-kaios.netlify.app`](https://tilos-radio-for-kaios.netlify.app/) instead [`stream.tilos.hu`](http://stream.tilos.hu/)  for audio streaming. KaiOS requires the URL has to be under `HTTPS`.

Setting up a [proxy](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/#proxy-to-another-service) is a workaround, and hopefully, I can remove it once a certificate is added.
